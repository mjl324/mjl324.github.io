### Projects

**[Fatal Police Shootings Data Analysis](/pdf/FPS.pdf)**

I worked on this project when I was first learning how to visualize data using R, while also pursuing other interests in social justice. I used data from the Washington Post that records every fatal police shooting since 2015, so I could find for myself the disproportionate rate of fatal police killings among young Black men through exploratory data analysis in R.

**[COVID-19 Vaccination Analysis](/pdf/Vax.pdf)**

This project similarly came from a place of curiosity as my last project: I wanted to match my findings with what I was reading in the news, which at the time was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this R markdown file, I analyzed county-level vaccination data from the CDC for three US states, including my home state of New Jersey.

**[Housing Prices Forecast](/pdf/Time_Series_Final.pdf)**

The housing market is becoming more and more volatile in recent years with skyrocketing rent and mortgage rates. Using methods like regression, ARIMA/ARMA models, and Holt-Winters forecasting, I tested models and chose one to predict what the median sales price of houses would look like in the next four years based on predictors such as 30-year fixed mortgage rate and homeownership rate.

**[Math Scores in Secondary Schools](/pdf/Math_Scores.pdf)**

I chose the Student Performance Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to perform common statistical learning methods and figure out the best model based on its cross-validated predictive performance. The models in consideration included penalized lasso regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, and random forest.

**[Data Consulting for Let's Chow](https://www.letschow.org/)**

Let's Chow, formerly Chow Corp, is a nonprofit that connects with military veterans with culinary education and starting their own business. Through Hoyalytics, a student-run data analytics club at Georgetown University for which I am VP of Analytics, a team of data consultants and I pitched new locations in San Diego for another veteran-run food truck. We gathered data from parking meters, foot traffic, and other food truck locations to pinpoint four optimal locations in SD from across the country.
