[Fatal Police Shootings Data Analysis](/pdf/Project_2.html)
I worked this project when I was first learning how to visualize data using R, while also pursuing other interests in social justice. I used data from the Washington Post that records every fatal police shooting since January 1, 2015 and tried to find for myself the disproportionate rate of fatal police killings among Black young men.
