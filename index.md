### Projects

[Fatal Police Shootings Data Analysis](/pdf/Project_2.html)
I did this project when I was first learning how to visualize data using R, while also pursuing other interests in social justice. I used data from the Washington Post that records every fatal police shooting since January 1, 2015 and tried to replicate findings that I read in the news.
