### Projects

**[DBMS Implementation](/dbms.md)**

I built a database management system (DBMS) in Python that is able to parse SQL language. It is able to handle errors, referential integrity, and most basic database schema functions.

---
**[SQL Application](/pdf/FPS.pdf)**

Through SQL queries, this project aimed to demonstrate the connection carbon emissions of each state, where the top tech companies are located, and market data of these companies. The relational database design follows third normal form.

**[Fatal Police Shootings Data Analysis](/pdf/FPS.pdf)**

I worked on this project when I was first learning how to visualize data using R, while also pursuing other interests in social justice. I used data from the Washington Post that records every fatal police encounter since 2015, so I could find for myself the disproportionate rate of fatal police killings among young Black men through exploratory data analysis in R.

**Figure 1**: A histogram where the width of the bins are unequal. Instead, the bin widths are proportional to the US population of each race, and the heights are the frequency of fatal police encounters. Clearly, Black people do not make up a large proportion of the US population, yet they experience the highest rate of fatal police killings compared to every other race.

**[COVID-19 Vaccination Analysis](/pdf/Vax.pdf)**

This project similarly came from a place of curiosity as my last project: I wanted to match my findings with what I was reading in the news, which at the time was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this R markdown file, I analyzed county-level vaccination data from the CDC for three US states, including my home state of New Jersey.

**[Housing Prices Forecast](/pdf/TimeSeriesFinal.pdf)**

The housing market is becoming more and more volatile in recent years with skyrocketing rent and mortgage rates. Using methods like regression, ARIMA/ARMA models, and Holt-Winters forecasting, I tested models and chose one to predict what the median sales price of houses would look like in the next four years based on predictors such as 30-year fixed mortgage rate and homeownership rate.

**Figure 3**: I forecasted median housing prices for approximately the next four years, using an ARIMA(2, 3, 3) model. According to my model, housing prices, currently at $467,700.00, will have skyrocketed to $672,875.60 by Q1 of 2027. Examining the trend in the median housing prices leading up to the 2008 recession, there is a similar peak in housing prices. Although prices may not reach the prediction that I came up with, there is still chance for a potential housing bubble.

**[Math Scores in Secondary Schools](/pdf/MathScores.pdf)**

I chose the Student Performance Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to perform common statistical learning methods and figure out the best model based on its cross-validated predictive performance. The models in consideration included penalized lasso regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, and random forest.

**Figure 4**: A diagram of my regression tree using fancyRpartPlot() function from the *rattle* library in R. The final tree has 22 terminal nodes. Node 2, which contains students who have failed before, contains the most amount of students (63) predicted to score low in Math.

**[Data Consulting for Let's Chow](https://www.letschow.org/)**

Let's Chow, formerly Chow Corp, is a nonprofit that connects with military veterans with culinary education and starting their own business. Through Hoyalytics, a student-run data analytics club at Georgetown University for which I am VP of Analytics, a team of data consultants and I pitched new locations in San Diego for another veteran-run food truck. We gathered data from parking meters, foot traffic, and other food truck locations to pinpoint four optimal locations in SD from across the country.
